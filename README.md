# Optimizing-Student-Records-Management-at-Qatar-University
The project, "Optimizing Student Records Management at Qatar University," aimed to design a new data structure (ADT) for efficient management of student records. The team combined multiple basic data structures, including hash tables and trees, to optimize insertion, deletion, and searching processes. The student ID at Qatar University, composed of the year of admission and student number, was utilized to enhance the system. The proposed data structure offered basic operations such as insertion, searching by ID or year, deletion, and printing all student information. The team selected the optimal solution from given options, considering performance and functionality. An interactive application was developed, providing users with options to add, search, delete, and print student records, with data serialization for future use.
